This project involves building a file management system with several key features using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redis, and other related technologies. Here's a breakdown of the requirements and tasks to help you organize your work:

### **Project Overview**

**Objective:**
- Build a platform for uploading and managing files with features like user authentication, file listing, uploading, permission changes, and thumbnail generation.

**Features to Implement:**
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Token-based authentication for secure access.
   - Endpoints for user sign-in, sign-out, and profile retrieval.

2. **File Management:**
   - List all files.
   - Upload new files.
   - Change file permissions.
   - View specific files.
   - Generate thumbnails for image files.

### **Tasks Breakdown**

1. **Redis Utilities (utils/redis.js):**
   - Create a `RedisClient` class to manage Redis operations (connectivity, get/set/del operations).
   - Implement methods for checking connection status, and CRUD operations with expiration support.

2. **MongoDB Utilities (utils/db.js):**
   - Create a `DBClient` class for MongoDB interactions.
   - Implement methods to check connectivity and retrieve counts for users and files.

3. **API Creation (server.js, routes/index.js, controllers/AppController.js):**
   - Set up an Express server.
   - Define routes and link them to appropriate controller methods.
   - Implement endpoints for application status and stats retrieval.

4. **User Management (controllers/UsersController.js):**
   - Implement user creation endpoint with email and password validation.
   - Handle missing or duplicate fields, hash passwords, and store user details.

5. **User Authentication (controllers/AuthController.js):**
   - Implement sign-in and sign-out functionality with token generation and validation.
   - Implement endpoint to retrieve user details based on token.

6. **File Management (controllers/FilesController.js):**
   - Implement file upload functionality including handling file types and storage paths.
   - Implement endpoints for listing files and retrieving specific file details.
   - Handle file permissions and data storage.

### **Development Setup**

**Dependencies:**
- Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redis, Bull, image-thumbnail, mime-types, and UUID for various functionalities.

**Development Tools:**
- Use ESLint for code linting.
- Use Mocha for testing.
- Use Nodemon for development server and worker restarts.

### **Implementation Tips**

1. **Code Organization:**
   - Separate concerns into different files (controllers, utils, routes).
   - Use a `utils` folder for reusable functions and classes (e.g., RedisClient, DBClient).

2. **Testing:**
   - Test endpoints using tools like `curl` or Postman.
   - Implement unit tests for critical components using Mocha and Chai.
